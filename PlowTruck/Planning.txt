PlowTruck
	Core - Master class that accesses other classes to perform the operations needed
	Operations - Contains methods necessary to Scan, Plow, and perform other operations on the system
	Configuration - Object that will contain the configuration of what files go where
	Configuraitons - List<Configuration>
	Actions - Contains the definition for how the file will be actioned
	Result - Data structure for the objects that will be used to describe files and operations
	Results - List<Result>
	
What are we concerned about?
	Files
		Extensions (as per configuration)
			Has extension name
			Has destination folder name
			Has date criteria
			
	Actions
		Should be a class that contains the necessary properties per type
			Move 
				- has a destination property
			Archive
				- has a file destination property
			Delete
				- doesn't really need anything
			Exclude (obsolete) - if we filter the file search for the extension, this isn't really needed
				- also doesn't really need anything
			MoveAndArchive
				- has a destination property (i.e. folder to move to)
				- has a file destination property (archive filename only, i.e. Archive.7z)
	
	Scan - Returns Results collection
		Get files from specified directory (we can filter for the extension; will result in multiple passes, but no need for exclude action)
		Foreach file
			Examine criteria for file: date, date range
			Set action to be taken (read from configuration)
			Store in result set
		Return result set

[Definitions]
Core
	Core() { create Operations class } - we'll always need an operations class
	Results ScanDir(string dirPath) - Will scan the directory and provide a collection of results
	Results PlowDir(string dirPath) - Will plow the directory and provide a collection of results
	void SetConfiguration(string configFile) - Will attempt to load an xml file of configurations
	void SetConfiguration(Configuration config) - Will load configs when passed a collection

Operations
	Scan(string dirPath, Configuration config) - Will scan based on configurations
	Plow(string dirPath, Configuration config) - Will scan first and then plow
	Plow(Results scanResults) - Will plow based on the results already found in a scan
	<create/save configuration>

Configuration
	string Extension
	string DestinationFolder
	date FixedDate
	daterange RangedDate
	Action actiontype

Actions - This seems fucky...
	Move
		string Destination
	Archive
		string ArchiveFilename
	Delete
		string Filename?
	MoveAndArchive
		string Destination
		string ArchiveFilename
